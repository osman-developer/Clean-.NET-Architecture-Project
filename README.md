The purpose of this project is to show the clean architecture of how a .NET project should be built.
The project is cut into 4 projects, 1 API and 3 Class Library projects.

The domain is so dummy, it contains the interfaces, models, and DTOs.
The infrastructure handles the connectivity with the DB so it contains the context, the migrations.
